# useContext-Intermediate

**useContext-Intermediate** is a collection of three intermediate-level React projects that showcase practical use cases of the `useContext` hook for global state management. These projects simulate real-world features like shopping carts, user preferences, and task filtering.

## 📁 Projects

1. **ShoppingCart-Context**  
   Build a shopping cart with global state, item management, and persistence using `CartContext`.

2. **UserSettings-Context**  
   Manage user preferences like theme and language across the app using `SettingsContext` and `AuthContext`.

3. **TaskManager-Context**  
   Create a task manager with filtering capabilities using `TasksContext` and `FilterContext`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each project is located in its own folder. You can run them individually:

```bash
  cd ProjectFolderName
  npm install
  npm run dev
```

### Example:

```bash
  cd ShoppingCart-Context
  npm install
  npm run dev
```
